How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Awesome feature. Showing only the changes helped a lot to find the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Yeah. That's again a cool idea. Accessing the entire history whenever required.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Choosing when to commit manually is more sensible ofcourse. It gives a better
    access to the history but, it requires us to perform commits unlike 
    automatic save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
